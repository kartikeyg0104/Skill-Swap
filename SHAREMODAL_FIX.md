# ShareModal Error Fix

## Problem
The ShareModal component was throwing a TypeError: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'substring')` because it was expecting separate `postContent` and `postAuthor` props, but was being called with a `post` object.

## Error Location
- **File**: `frontend/skill-swap/src/components/FeatureSections.jsx`
- **Line**: 1080 (ShareModal component)
- **Error**: `postContent.substring(0, 100)` where `postContent` was undefined

## Root Cause
The ShareModal component was designed with this signature:
```jsx
export const ShareModal = ({ isOpen, onClose, postContent, postAuthor }) => {
  const [shareText, setShareText] = useState(`Check out this post by ${postAuthor}: "${postContent.substring(0, 100)}..."`);
  // ...
}
```

But it was being called from `Social.jsx` with a `post` object:
```jsx
<ShareModal 
  isOpen={showShare} 
  onClose={() => setShowShare(false)} 
  post={post}  // ❌ Wrong prop structure
/>
```

## Solution
Updated the ShareModal component to accept a `post` object and safely access its properties:

```jsx
export const ShareModal = ({ isOpen, onClose, post }) => {
  const [shareText, setShareText] = useState(
    post ? `Check out this post by ${post.author?.name || 'User'}: "${post.content?.substring(0, 100) || ''}..."` : ''
  );

  // Update share text when post changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (post) {
      setShareText(`Check out this post by ${post.author?.name || 'User'}: "${post.content?.substring(0, 100) || ''}..."`);
    }
  }, [post]);
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## Key Changes
1. **Props**: Changed from `{ postContent, postAuthor }` to `{ post }`
2. **Safe Access**: Used optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access nested properties
3. **Fallbacks**: Added fallback values (`|| 'User'`, `|| ''`) for undefined properties
4. **useEffect**: Added effect to update share text when post changes
5. **Null Check**: Added check for post existence before accessing properties

## Expected Post Object Structure
```jsx
const post = {
  id: '1',
  author: {
    id: 'user_id',
    name: 'User Name',
    profilePhoto: null,
    isVerified: true
  },
  content: 'Post content here...',
  timestamp: '2h',
  likes: 24,
  comments: 8,
  shares: 3,
  imageUrl: null,
  liked: false,
  bookmarked: false
}
```

## Testing
The fix handles these scenarios:
- ✅ Valid post object with content and author
- ✅ Post object with missing author name (falls back to 'User')
- ✅ Post object with missing content (falls back to empty string)
- ✅ Undefined post object (graceful handling)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/skill-swap/src/components/FeatureSections.jsx` - Updated ShareModal component

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The ShareModal component now works correctly with the post object structure used throughout the application.
